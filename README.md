Main idea of this project is to obtain solid understanding of next topics:
* ðŸ’» BackEnd API testing
* ðŸ¤– Test Automation with Python programing language & pyTest framework
* ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns in Automation Frameworks

## Project Structure
`tests/` - folder that contains all tests of the project in which assertions apply

`conftest.py` - contains methods & arrangements required for API request

`data.py` - contains pre-defined names, tags & data sets for arranging or applying assertions

`utils.py` - contains set of methods that processing response data (act) & allow to compare it with expected values

`requirements.txt` - contains names of libraries which is needed to be imported

`pytest.ini` - contains pytest markers

`Dockerfile` - that allows to assemble an image
