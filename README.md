Main idea of this project is to obtain solid understanding of next topics:
* üíª BackEnd API testing
* ü§ñ Test Automation with Python programing language & pyTest framework
* üé® Design Patterns in Automation Frameworks

## Project Structure
`tests/` - folder that contains all tests of the project in which assertions apply

`conftest.py` - contains methods & arrangements required for API request

`data.py` - contains pre-defined names, tags & data sets for arranging or applying assertions

`utils.py` - contains set of methods that processing response data (act) & allow to compare it with expected values

`requirements.txt` - contains names of libraries which is needed to be imported

`pytest.ini` - contains pytest markers

`Dockerfile` - that allows to assemble an image

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èGetting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` for dependency management

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasonTwoK/waifu_api_test.git
cd waifu_api_test
python -m venv env
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
### To apply test launch üöÄ use next command:
```commandline
pytest . -v
```

## Environments
- Some API calls require authorization token `AUTH_TOKEN` to be applied. To get it please follow this [Guide of Generating a Token](https://docs.waifu.im/authentication#generating-a-token).
- Guide of getting [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID#h_01HRSTXPS5H5D7JBY2QKKPVKNA)

### To setup environment 
1. Create file `.env` in project folder
2. Add generated `AUTH_TOKEN` & `DISCORD_ID`
3. File should have similar structure:
```python
AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DISCORD_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
